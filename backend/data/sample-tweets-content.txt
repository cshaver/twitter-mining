@AmericanAir I've never encountered ruder gate agents than your ATL staff. Unbelievable.
On the shuttle, heading to Toronto to catch our @WestJet flight to Deer Lake!  #stylishtravel http://t.co/2GrAFWgsI9
@sedlaw15 @AmericanAir We couldn't be more excited about spending the new few hours with you! See you soon!
We're looking forward to several days #SavvySleuthing in #NYC. Flying via @TurkishAirlines. @nycgov @GansevoortPark @HotelGansevoort #travel
Does anyone know how early I can check in for my #americanairlines flight at #jfkairport? @AmericanAir
@JetBlue The only thing that would have made it better would be inflight internet service. Everything else was perfectâ€”and I hate flying!
